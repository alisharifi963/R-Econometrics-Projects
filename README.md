Title:
Economic Data Analysis Using R: GDP, Corruption, FDI, and Unemployment Trends

Description:
This repository contains R scripts for analyzing key economic indicators, including GDP growth, control of corruption, unemployment rate, and foreign direct investment (FDI) as a percentage of GDP. The analysis spans data from 2000 to 2023 for five countries: China, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Rwanda, and India. The dataset is sourced from the World Bank's WDI API, and the project utilizes data visualization and cleaning techniques to uncover trends and insights.

Features:
Data Extraction: Automated data collection using the WDI package for key indicators.
Data Cleaning: Removing missing or anomalous values to ensure accuracy in analysis.
Visualizations:
GDP growth trends by country.
Trends in control of corruption.
Unemployment rate over time.
FDI as a percentage of GDP.
Comparison of GDP growth and unemployment in Rwanda.
Reproducibility: The scripts are modular and reusable for similar analyses with other countries or indicators.
How to Use:
Install Required Libraries:
WDI: For fetching World Bank data.
dplyr: For data manipulation.
ggplot2: For creating visualizations.
Run the Scripts:
Execute the script to fetch, clean, and visualize the data.
Analyze the Results:
The visualizations provide insights into the economic performance and institutional quality of the selected countries.
Applications:
Policy Research: Understanding economic trends and institutional impacts across countries.
Academic Projects: Useful for students and researchers in economics and data science.
Comparative Analysis: Examine economic growth vs. governance quality and labor market trends.
Potential Extensions:
Include additional countries or indicators for a broader analysis.
Integrate advanced statistical models (e.g., regression) to quantify relationships.
Folder Structure:
scripts/: Contains the R script (analysis.R).
data/: Placeholder for any pre-downloaded datasets (if required).
results/: Output visualizations (can be saved as PNGs).
Future Updates:
This project may be expanded to include sectoral FDI analysis, education levels, and gender-specific insights.
